/* having and issue doing this section of the programme seeking assisstance.
Create a RoomServiceMeal class that inherits from both RestaurantMeal and HotelService.
Whenever you create a RoomServiceMeal object, the constructor assigns the string "room service" to the name of
 the service field, and $4.00 is assigned to the service fee inherited from HotelService. 
 
 Include a RoomServiceMeal function that displays all of the fields in a RoomServiceMeal by calling display functions from the two parent 
classes. Additionally, the display function should display the total of the meals plus the room service fee.  In a main()function, instantiate a 
 RoomServiceMeal object that inherits from both classes.   */
